## Problem Statement
For this project, you play a role as a newly hired Data Analyst for a pharmaceutical company.

It's the year 2022 and aliens are well known to be living amongst us.

Unfortunately, some of the aliens are a bit... too alien... and would like to fit into society a bit more.

So it's up to you to find the best state(s) we should market our new prescription.

It would be helpful to know...

- If these aliens are hostile
- Their diet
- Their age
- It's up to you to clean up the data and report back.

## Datasets used
This dataset contains only three tables named 
 - aliens
 - details
 - location
